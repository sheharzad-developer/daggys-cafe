This is a placeholder for the notification sound file. You'll need to replace this with an actual MP3 audio file for the sound notifications to work properly.

To add a real notification sound:
1. Find or create a short notification sound (1-3 seconds)
2. Convert it to MP3 format
3. Replace this file with your actual audio file
4. Keep the filename as 'notification-sound.mp3'

- Your device's system sounds
